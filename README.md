# python-challenge

The following python challenged was completed using many examples from the ASU bootcamp session June2023.
Specifically, my PyPoll "code" was modeled after the "Zoo" example provided by our instructor. 
My PyBank code was modeled after examples used in class and also a review session found in YouTube. The YouTube review I was able to learn creating an output variable and using that single variable in the print statement. Also very helpful for formatting final results.
